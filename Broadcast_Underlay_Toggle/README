!!!! DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR PRODUCTION SDA NETWORKS WITHOUT TAC/BU APPROVAL !!!!!!

In case a Fabric Edge node (or L2 Handoff/IPDB Border) loses its own S,G mroute
to create L2 flooding traffic once the following possibilities are discarded:

 1) Lo0 Interface has PIM enabled
 2) The Fabric node already received Flood-eligible traffic (Bcast, Link Local Mcast, TTL1, etc)
 3) PIM and multicast routing configuration is already in place

These S,G entries are supposed to be created on demand of any flood-elegible traffic
In case these are not created locally in the device, toggling the "broadcast-underlay" command
under "router lisp" can potentially resolve this condition.

Unfortunately, close to no debugs or logs can be collected by the time this 
issue is observed, making it difficult to find an RCA for it.

For critical produciton networks where this issue is observed in a particular VLAN, this script can 
assist to continously track the existence of a local S,G in the affected device.

If the logic determines that the S,G is gone, it will do the following:

1) Print a log saying that the S,G is gone
2) Toggle Broadcast Underlay for the first L2 LISP instance
3) Log Collection which is currently disabled by a commentary  #logging_stuff()

Limitations: This script can only work on nodes with the same broadcast underlay group
In case there are different L2 flooding groups, this script needs to be adjusted.

Again, do NOT use this script without the approval of TAC/BU in production networks
