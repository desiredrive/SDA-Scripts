!!!! DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR PRODUCTION SDA NETWORKS WITHOUT TAC/BU APPROVAL !!!!!!

This is a simple script to overcome a currently, not supported feature
under SDA which is using DNA Spaces as AAA Server.

The problem: DNA Center will provision DNA Spaces as AAA server
with a shared secret with the format: pac key 7 xxxxxx

The pac keyword will ultimately trigger a CTS request to this server to
obtain a PAC key, DNA Spaces cannot currently reply to these requests.

As part of RADIUS Timeout in the device, it can mark the servers as DEAD, 
this condition can prevent the WLC to authenticate clients against the 
DNA Spaces server, causing small but noticeable outages during production

This is a python script that can be installed in C9800 WLCs with GuestShell
It can run from an EEM script to schedule its execution every 300 seconds
The performed tasks are:

  Verify if any of the targeted RADIUS servers have been provisioned with PAC shared secrets
  Change the wrong shared secret format by removing the PAC word from it
  Verify if there is any unexpected server list for RADIUS accounting 
  Change the wrong accounting list by adding back the original accounting list
  Upon detection of a change of either shared secret or accounting list, a copy of show runs before and after the change will be saved in bootflash:
  As part of Guestshell logging, iosp logs are cleaned every iteration

1)	Enable IOX on the WLC:

conf t 
iox
app-hosting appid guestshell
 app-vnic management guest-interface 0

2)	Enable GuestShell, it can take up to 5 minutes to finish:

WLC#guestshell enable
Interface will be selected if configured in app-hosting
Please wait for completion

Guestshell enabled successfully

3)	Create a text file and paste the contents of the python script using VI, press “i” to enable insert mode, paste the script, press “Esc” and type “wq! And Enter”:

WLC#guestshell run bash
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ vi pac_checker.py
////// Use “i" to get into insert mode, paste the script, then escape and :wq!”  ////////
~
:wq!

4)	Confirm that the script has been saved without errors:

[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ cat pac_checker.py

5)	Exit GuestShell and configure the following EEM Script to run it every 5 minutes, you can change this timer according to your own preference, here it is configured to run every 300 seconds/5 minutes:

event manager applet GuestShell_PAC authorization bypass
event timer watchdog time 300
action 1.0 cli command "enable"
action 2.9 cli command "guestshell run python3 pac_checker.py"
